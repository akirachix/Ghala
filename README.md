# POST HARVEST LOSS IN KENYA

# Project Introduction
Agriculture is Kenya's most important economic contributor. The majority of it occurs in the country's rural areas, where farmers rely on it for a living. However, food losses that occur during processes in the food supply chain mostly at the storage level greatly impact the quality and the quantity of the final product. This is because farmers store maize grains that are below the optimum moisture content resulting to conditions such as aflatoxin and mold leading to significant losses.

# Project Description
This project aims to enable farmers to check the moisture level in maize grains to ensure optimum dryness for storage hence reducing the losses they incur before selling their produce.

# Targeted Users
Farmers.
Cereal traders.
